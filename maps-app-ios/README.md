# Maps-App iOS

The Maps App for iOS shows how a robust application can be built around the ArcGIS Platform using the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/). It demonstrates best practices around some simple but key functionality of the ArcGIS Runtime. You can use the Maps App as is, or extend it to meet your specific needs.

## Features
* Place Search
* Geocode addresses
* Reverse Geocode
* Turn-by-turn Directions
* Dynamically switch basemaps
* Open Web Maps
* Work with ArcGIS Online or an on-premise ArcGIS Portal
* OAuth authentication

## Best Practices
The project also demonstrates some patterns for building real-world apps around the ArcGIS Runtime SDK.

* Defining a modular, decoupled UI that operates alongside a map view.
* Asynchronous service and UI coding patterns.
* Internal application communication patterns.

## Get Started
You will need [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) and the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/) (v100.1 or later) installed locally.

Clone the GitHub repository and open `maps-app-ios.xcodeproj` in Xcode.

### Configure the app
The app can be run as is, but for turn-by-turn directions and to browse and open Web Maps, you will need to do some one-off configuration, as follows:

1. Register an ArcGIS Portal Application.
2. Configure the Maps App project to reference that application.
3. License the app to remove the Developer Mode watermark.

#### 1. Register an Application 
For OAuth configuration, create a new Application in your ArcGIS Portal to obtain a `Client ID` and configure a `Redirect URL`. The Client ID configures the ArcGIS Runtime to show your users that the application was built by you and can be trusted. The Redirect URL configures the OAuth process to then return to your app once authentication is complete.

1. Log in to [https://developers.arcgis.com](https://developers.arcgis.com) with either your ArcGIS Organizational Account or an ArcGIS Developer Account.
2. Register a new Application. ![Register new application](/docs/images/create-application.png)
3. In the Authentication tab, note the Client ID and add a Redirect URL, e.g. `my-maps-app://auth`. We will use this URL in the **Configuring the project** section below. ![Configure new application](/docs/images/configure-application.png)

#### 2. Configuring the project
Open the project in Xcode and browse to the `maps-app-ios` target's `Info` panel and expand the `AGSConfiguration` dictionary (see steps 1-4 in the screenshot below).

1. Set the `ClientID` value to the application's Client ID noted above.
2. Set the `AppURLScheme` value to match the Redirect URL scheme (the part *before* the `://`, e.g. `my-maps-app`) configured in "Register an Application" above. Note how the `AppURLScheme` and `AuthURLPath` combine to construct the Redirect URL. ![Configure the App URL Scheme](/docs/images/configure-xcode-target.png)
3. Expand the **URL Types** section and modify the existing entry.
    1. The **Identifier** doesn't matter, but should be unique (e.g. `com.my-org.my-maps-app`).
    2. The **URL Scheme** should match the Redirect URL scheme (the part *before* the `://`, e.g. `my-maps-app`) configured in "Register an Application" above.

#### 3. License the app (Optional)
To remove the _Licensed for Developer Use Only_ watermark on the map view, set the `LicenseKey` in the `AGSConfiguration` dictionary. Retrieve this value by clicking the `Show my ArcGIS Runtime Lite license key` at the top-right of the [Licensing Your ArcGIS Runtime App](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcgis-runtime/licensing/) page (you must be logged in).

## Architecture
The Maps App is built around 4 core components:

1. A singleton `AppContext` to manage the app's current state ([learn more](Maps%20App/App%20Context)).
2. A singleton `ArcGISServices` component to handle geocode and directions calls to the ArcGIS platform ([learn more](Maps%20App/ArcGIS%20Services)).
2. An interactive Map View and [controller](UI/Map%20View).
3. A decoupled, [modular UI](UI).

Any component of the app can directly read and write the `AppContext`. Changes to the `AppContext` raise Notifications using iOS's in-built `NSNotificationCenter` to which the Map View and the UI can react.

## App Lifecycle
When the app starts up, the MapsAppDelegate instance is created, which instatiates three singletons as instance variables:

* appContext
* arcGISServices
* preferences

iOS then calls the MapsAppDelegate's `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` function where the app sets the ArcGIS Runtime License and sets up the initial AGSPortal object. This object will point to either ArcGIS Online or a custom on-premise ArcGIS Portal, depending on what URL is stored in the user preferences.

iOS will then begin setting up the UI. This is a Single View Application and the main storyboard defines the MapViewController and various UI components to go with it.

## App Usage

The Map View operates in one of 3 "modes":

* Searching
* Display a Geocode Result
* Display a Directions Result

The main UI component is the Feedback View at the top of the Map View. It reflects the current mode and can be a SearchBar, a Geocode Result, or a Directions Result.

 The controls at the bottom right are as follows:

 | Icon | Description |
 | ---- | ----------- |
 | ![GPS Tracking](/docs/images/control-gps.png) | Cycle through GPS recentering modes. |
 | ![Basemap Picker](/docs/images/control-basemaps.png) | Display a basemap picker. |
 | ![Account View](/docs/images/control-account.png) | Display the Account Items viewer. |
