# User Interface
The Maps App's modular UI comprises the following components:

* [Map View](Map%20View)
* [Feedback View](Feedback%20View)
    * [Suggestions View](Suggestions%20View)
    * [Directions Maneuver View](Directions%20View)
* [Account View & Web Maps Browser](Account%20View)
* [Basemaps Browser](Basemaps%20View)
* [North Arrow](NorthArrowView.swift)

The Web Map Browser and Basemap Browser both make use of a [Portal Item Browser](Portal%20Items%20Browser) control that can display an array of Portal Items.

Many of these components can be reused in your own applications.
