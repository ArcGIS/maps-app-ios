# Maps-App iOS

The Maps App for iOS shows how a robust application can be built around the ArcGIS Platform using the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/). It demonstrates best practices around some simple but key functionality of the ArcGIS Runtime. You can use the Maps App as is, or extend it to meet your specific needs.

## Features
* Place Search
* Geocode addresses
* Reverse Geocode
* Turn-by-turn Directions
* Dynamically switch basemaps
* Open Web Maps
* Work with ArcGIS Online or an on-premise ArcGIS Portal
* OAuth authentication

## Best Practices
The project also demonstrates some patterns for building real-world apps around the ArcGIS Runtime SDK.

* Defining a modular, decoupled UI that operates alongside a map view
* Asynchronous service and UI coding patterns
* Internal application communication patterns

## Get Started
To learn more about this project and get started, see [here](maps-app-ios).

## Requirements
